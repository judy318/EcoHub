      <p class = "Animal-information"> Sadly, there are now more than 7,000 endangered species, and we must try to stop this. There are lot's of things you can do to help them, along with their habitats and the environment in general. <br>
        Here are some examples you can implement in your everyday life: <br></br>
          - Reduce and reduce: This helps reduce energy consumption and reduces contamination.
        <br>
        - Don't use harsh chemicals: They poison aquatic life
          <br>
        - Support as many organizations that fight to save endangered animals as you can
          <br>
        - Reduce or remove meat, dairy and/or eggs from your diet: Animal farming really harms the environment
          <br>
        - Never purchase products made from threatened or endangered species.
          <br>
        - Keep learning about endangered species, especially in you area.
